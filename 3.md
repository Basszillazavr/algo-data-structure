# Lecture 2 & Practical 3: Introduction to Sorting Algorithms ($O(n^2)$) üîÑ

## **Lecture 2: Introduction to Sorting Algorithms**

### **1. What is Sorting?**

**Sorting** is the process of arranging a list of elements (numbers, strings, objects) into a specific order, typically numerical or lexicographical (alphabetical). Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science.

* **Importance:** Efficient sorting is essential because many advanced algorithms, like Binary Search, rely on having pre-sorted data to achieve optimal performance.

### **2. Stability in Sorting**

An algorithm is **stable** if it preserves the relative order of elements with **equal keys** (values).

* **Stable:** If you sort a list of products by Price, and two products have the same price, a stable sort ensures that the one which appeared first in the original list remains first in the sorted list.
* **Unstable:** The relative order of elements with equal keys might be swapped.

### **3. Two Fundamental $O(n^2)$ Algorithms**

These two algorithms are simple to understand but are generally too slow for large datasets.

#### **A. Selection Sort** (–°–æ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–æ–º)

* **Idea:** Repeatedly find the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swap it with the element at the current position.
* **Key Feature:** Selection Sort performs the **minimum number of swaps** (exactly $n-1$ swaps for an array of size $n$).
* **Time Complexity (Worst/Average/Best):** $O(n^2)$
* **Space Complexity (Auxiliary):** $O(1)$ (It sorts **in-place**).

#### **B. Insertion Sort** (–°–æ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞ –≤—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞–º–∏)

* **Idea:** Build the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input and inserts each element into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
* **Key Feature:** Very efficient for small lists or lists that are **almost sorted**.
* **Time Complexity:**
    * **Best Case:** $O(n)$ (when the array is already sorted).
    * **Worst/Average Case:** $O(n^2)$.
* **Space Complexity (Auxiliary):** $O(1)$ (It sorts **in-place**).
